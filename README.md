# 🎓 GPA Calculator (Java)

This is a simple command-line GPA calculator written in Java.  
It allows students to enter their grades across multiple semesters and calculates both the semester GPA and the overall cumulative GPA.

## ✨ Features
- Convert letter grades (A, B, C, D, F) into GPA points.
- Calculate GPA for each semester individually.
- Compute the overall cumulative GPA across all semesters.
- Provide personalized feedback based on GPA results.
- Input validation for invalid grades.

## 🖥️ How It Works
1. The program asks how many semesters you’ve taken.
2. For each semester, it asks how many classes you took and the letter grades for those classes.
3. It calculates the semester GPA and prints it.
4. After all semesters are entered, it calculates the general GPA and displays it with a motivational message.

🚀 Future Improvements
- Save GPA history to a file for tracking progress.
- Create a GUI version using JavaFX or Swing.
